\subsection{Quality Attributes related to SW and services in production}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \miguel{Scalability. Depending on the volume of the data or the computational needs, it's a matter of system design, but eventually of the
% quality of the platform/software.}

% \dg{[Jael, Daniel] Make sure this work aligns with SG1, which takes into account the software research cycle.}

% [Abdulrahman] Define an agreed upon procedure for SW packaging. What to have as containers/conda packages, what to have as e.g. Easybuild recipes. Should we promote one portable solution or a combination of several?

% \eli{Portability. Depending on the design of the software.}

% \miguel{The problem of the containers (Docket et al.) and software development in online platforms. Advantage of containers: easier to release
% and to ensure reproducibility and to ensure the service. Disadvantages: containers freeze the environment, and thus they stop receiving bug
% fixing and security updates. Dependency with outdated software components.}

% \miguel{Quality of documentation: is the documentation of the research SW always synchronized with its release?}

% \miguel{Is the research SW associated with any scientific papers?
% For example, k-means clustering in scikit-learn \url{https://scikit-learn.org/stable///modules/clustering.html#k-means}) is associated with:
% “k-means++: The advantages of careful seeding” Arthur, David, and Sergei Vassilvitskii, Proceedings of the eighteenth annual ACM-SIAM symposium
% on Discrete algorithms, Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (2007)
% The source code provides the author names, but no reference paper:
% \url{https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/main/sklearn/cluster/_kmeans.py}
% However, is it associated with any other paper which provides a detailed procedure and a pseudocode? Without this , one can't have a good level of reproducibility.}

% \miguel{Does the SW perform self tests? Say, unit tests.}

% \miguel{Does the SW follow some known methodology which includes verifications in order to ensure it works well? At which level? For example,
% if it uses continuous integration, does it include any step to ensure that the results are scientifically valid, or just unit tests?}

% \miguel{Stability of research SW. Does it ensure backwards compatibility between versions?}

% \cerlane{Do we mean 'Maintenance' or 'Maintainability'?}

% \cerlane{Traditionally “portability” can refer to the portability across hardware architecture, system and platform (compilers and libraries)
% by applying good software engineering practices. With containers, portability can also be achieved by restricting the supported system and platform
% in the container. A multi-architecture container can further improve portability.}

% \cerlane{Reproducibility is easier to achieve on the same system, software and hardware. However, it doesn't always imply a complete numerical
% reproducibility. To achieve numerical reproducibility, one would have to even avoid the use of certain optimisation compiler options, optimised Maths 
% libraries and apply very good software engineering techniques when applying algorithms, particularly with MPI.}
