\section{Quality Characteristics}

A significant notion in software engineering is \textit{quality}, understood as a series of desirable particularities that are met in \textit{good} computer programs, meaning that they are well adapted to their purpose, accurate, highly available, or any other property which makes them excellent.
Whereas this is a concept which is easy to understand, arriving at a consensus on how to properly define it, is a significantly more complex task. Indeed, the problem can be address from plenty of different perspectives, each of them giving more or less importance to some of the particularities.

It is not the goal of this report to propose any particular definitions, but to analyse how the problem has been addressed in relevant works in the literature and how the characteristics can be classified as attributes. As such, in Section \ref{subsec:sqm_survey} we detail the method used for a survey of the literature.

In Section~\ref{subsect:sqchar} we review what are, according to the literature, the \textit{characteristics} that can be related to good software. The characteristics can be related to quality from very different points of view (ranging from metrics of the source code to service operability, just as an example). These  are classified as \textit{attributes} in Section~\ref{subsec:SW_quality_attributes}.

\subsection{Software Quality models: survey}
\label{subsec:sqm_survey}

The classification into characteristics and attributes is based on a thorough review of the literature, in order to avoid biases on the classification and recommendations with the personal preferences or pre-established beliefs of the members of the \textit{sub-group}. We followed the protocol and methodology proposed by Kitchenham and Charters~\cite{keele2007guidelines} consisting of the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Source selection and search}: We searched in the SCOPUS database, including the top five journals in software engineering related to software~\footnote{\url{https://research.com/journals-rankings/computer-science/software-programming}} and articles of the  ``International Conference on Software Engineering'', one of the top venues for software engineering. We also added documents and web resources that the Task Force \textit{sub-group} considered relevant. The search included the keywords \textit{``software quality''} in the title of the publications. The following journals were considered:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering.
        \item Empirical Software Engineering.
        \item Journal of Systems and Software.
        \item Software \& Systems Modeling.
        \item Information and Software Technology.
        \item IEEE Software.
        \item Software Quality Journal.
    \end{itemize}

    The following SQL query was used to filter out the articles in this step:
    \begin{tiny}
    \begin{verbatim}
        TITLE ( software  AND quality )  AND  
            ( LIMIT-TO ( EXACTSRCTITLE ,  "Software Quality Journal" )  
            OR  LIMIT-TO ( EXACTSRCTITLE ,  "Proceedings International Conference On Software Engineering" ) 
            OR  LIMIT-TO ( EXACTSRCTITLE ,  "IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering" )
            OR  LIMIT-TO ( EXACTSRCTITLE ,  "Empirical Software Engineering" ) 
            OR  LIMIT-TO ( EXACTSRCTITLE ,  "Journal of Systems and Software" ) 
            OR  LIMIT-TO ( EXACTSRCTITLE ,  "Software & Systems Modeling" ) 
            OR  LIMIT-TO ( EXACTSRCTITLE ,  "Information and Software Technology" )  
            OR  LIMIT-TO ( EXACTSRCTITLE ,  "IEEE Software" )   
            )  AND  ( LIMIT-TO ( SUBJAREA ,  "COMP" )  OR  LIMIT-TO ( SUBJAREA ,  "ENGI" ) )  
    \end{verbatim}
    \end{tiny}

    We obtained 272 results with this process. Further filtering was applied with the following additional criteria:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Articles with no abstracts.
        \item Articles which were simple summaries of already existing proceedings.
        \item Articles that a preliminary review of the abstract and title made clear that were out of our scope.
        \item Articles that did not propose any quality dimensions. For example, those paper just discussing about practices.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Inclusion and exclusion criteria}: The most important criterion for not considering articles in our survey was; to exclude those which simply did not belong to the software engineering field. We did not attempt to tighten much the criteria for the exclusion, as we intended to gather as much related material as possible to be filtered out in the next field. Another early exclusion criterion was the language; we excluded non-English articles.

    \item \textbf{Selection procedure}: The selected articles were further analysed by reading their title and abstract. This allowed to assess the pertinence of the article to the software engineering domain and their relevance to be used as a source for general quality software recommendations, assuming it mentioned software quality attributes. 147 papers remained after this selection step. Although the protocol that we followed ensured that no human bias was introduced, it also prevented that some very relevant papers related to Quality were considered. Four additional articles were added in this step \cite{orviz_set_2017,orviz_fernandez_eosc-synergy_2020,raymond_software_2013,shepherdson_cessda_2019}, after the \textit{sub-group} discussed the issue.

    \item \textbf{Review process}: After the previous selection procedure, 19 relevant articles remained. These are the ones which are finally reviewed in our survey. We performed this step by groups of 2 or 3 reviewers per article, in our \textit{sub-group}.
\end{enumerate}

The list of relevant articles obtained by this procedure, allowed us to defined a list of characteristics and attributes which are presented in the following sections.

\subsection{Software Quality characteristics}
\label{subsect:sqchar}

We identified a list of significant quality characteristics mainly from three sources:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The ISO/IEC 25010:2011(E) standards~\cite{iso_25010_2011_2017}; is a norm that proposes two models for the characteristics. The first group is related to the context on which the software product is used, and contains five characteristics. The second group has eight characteristics according to characteristics of the software of computer system itself, without relying on how it is used.

    \item The ISO/IEC/IEEE 24765:2017 standard~\cite{iso_iec_24765_2017}; defines a common vocabulary for systems and software engineering, in a way that it is always applicable to general applications. This standardised list provides a vast quantity of very precise definitions that avoid trivial misinterpretations, and that therefore we apply in this report.

    \item The chapter \textit{Design Fundamentals} of the Microsoft Application Architecture Guide~\cite{microsoft_2010}; the chapter \textit{Quality Attributes} from the Microsoft's Application Architecture Guide also helped establishing a common terminology in our definitions.

\end{itemize}

The analysis of the existing literature resulted in a significant number of characteristics which were associated to the concept of quality. All the characteristics were taken into account in our study, but some of them where filtered out since they were not useful to perform the classification in quality attributes. Indeed, some characteristics were pertinent at the time of the publication of the article, but after a few years they became obsolete. For example, producing a very small sized compiled binary \textit{per se} as an indication of quality does not make much sense nowadays, whereas in the past it could be directly related to the ability of storing the program in a very limited memory or permanent media. Other characteristics were discarded because they were very specific to a given domain, such as real-time applications or critical systems. They remain valid characteristics to take into account, but they are not general enough or not applicable to Research Software or useful to the proposed recommendations.

We ended up with a list of 25 significant quality characteristics from the three abovementioned sources. The characteristics are defined as follows:

\section{Software Quality attributes and metrics}
\label{subsec:SW_quality_attributes}

The software quality characteristics which are classified in the previous section can actually be seen from very different points of view, thus allowing for a different type of classification of characteristics in different classes, that we will refer to as \textit{attributes}.

The procedure we followed was to identify a total of 241 quality attributes, that were gathered into a single table. We found that, depending on the source, the same attribute could be found under different names, but with a very similar definition of meaning. Those were merged to prevent duplicates.

We ended up with 132 quality attributes, it includes the references to the original articles used. We considered attributes which objectively could be treated as \textit{metrics}. The attributes were subdivided into six categories and, for each metric or attribute, a new codename was proposed in order to have a coherent naming convention throughout the document. The following categories and their codenames are proposed:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Source Code Metrics (\textbf{EOSC-SCMet}): 20 metrics. Metrics related to the source code, such as the number of lines of code or the number of assertions, for example.

    \item Time and Performance Metrics (\textbf{EOSC-TMet}): 11 metrics. Metrics related to time or periods time. For example, the number of resolved bug per period of time.

    \item Qualitative Attributes (\textbf{EOSC-Qual}): 30 attributes. Qualitative attributes are obtained in general through surveys to, or some manual analysis by sofware developers, administrators, or users. In general, these are not possible to automate and are in general subjetive.

    \item DevOps - Software Release and Management Attributes (\textbf{EOSC-SWRelMan}): 34 attributes. Largely based on the \textit{DevOps} methodology, they can be automated for verification. Although the possibility of having code reviews in the software development process is a manual step.

    \item DevOps - Testing Attributes (\textbf{EOSC-SWTest}): 25 attributes. Again based in DevOps, these are related to software testing and can also can be automatically verified. For example, whether integration tests are used in the system.

    \item Service Operability Attributes (\textbf{EOSC-SrvOps}): 12 attributes. They refer to scientific services or platforms in operation. For example, whether the system provides monitoring and accounting services.
\end{itemize}

Each attribute or metric entry has the following elements, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sqattr}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Codename: naming convention proposed by the \textit{sub-group};
    \item Name: as found in the source reference;
    \item Associated characteristics: one or more from subsection~\ref{subsect:sqchar};
    \item Definition: obtained from aggregating or merging the source references;
    \item Reference to the source articles.
\end{itemize}
